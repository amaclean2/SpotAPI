# SpotAPI

React + Redux application to create a Spotify library searcher

## Launch Instructions

Application Deployed on an AWS EC2 Server [here](http://52.14.191.202)

This is the github repo for the project

```git clone https://github.com/amaclean2/SpotAPI.git```

Make sure node and npm are installed

## Notes

I didn't implement any of the unit testing because I ran out of time, but the application is still small.
Can be added later

My TypeScript knowledge is still pretty basic but here's the app built from what I know
